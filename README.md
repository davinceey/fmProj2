### What I learned

Challenges: Trying to make the svg star align with the rest of the content.
            Trying to align the submit button at the centre.
I majorly learnt how to use the gradient property in transforming my main container's background color.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


### Continued development

I would need to still consider learning the css flexbox and how to easily manipulate it to my benefit, in creating sectioned layouts.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://www.developer.mozilla.org) - This helped me in learning how to perfectly use the gradient property in css. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
